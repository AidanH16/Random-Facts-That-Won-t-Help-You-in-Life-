HELLO!

This is my trivia game called "Random Facts That Won't Help You in Life!"

How to play:
1. Click the run button at the top of the screen.
2. The game will give you a run down on how to play.
3. When you encounter a true or false question, answer with "true" or "false".
4. When you encounter a multiple choice question, answer with "a" or "b".
(If you do not answer with any of these, the game will automatically count it as false)
5. At the end of the game, you will be given a total score. This will tell you how good you did.
6. When you play again, try beating that score you got.
7. Have fun!
